The issue in your README file is that it ends with a **dangling code block** that was never properly closed.

### ‚ùå The Problem:

At the very end, you have this:

```markdown
```

You can paste this directly into your `README.md` file on GitHub. Let me know if you'd like to add sections like screenshots, badges, or contribution guidelines.

```
```

This part is **wrapped inside a code block**, but it's just regular text. Since it's not meant to be code, it shouldn't be in triple backticks (\`\`\`), and also it's missing a closing backtick block, which breaks the Markdown rendering on GitHub.

---

### ‚úÖ The Fix:

Remove the incorrect triple backticks and treat the last paragraph as regular Markdown text. Here's the **corrected version**:

````markdown
